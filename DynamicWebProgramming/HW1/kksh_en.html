                <h2>A Local High School in Kaohsiung</h2>
                <p>I attended Guoguang Laboratory School, National Sun Yat-sen University (KKSH) for both junior and senior high.  
                Although it's not ranked among the top schools, the school culture is simple and the learning atmosphere is excellent.  
                Overall, it's a good school. I eventually got into NYCU through The Star Plan, 
                <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">mainly because it didn't require an interview</span>.</p>

                <h2>KKSH's Specialty: Oasis</h2>
                <p>When I first entered junior high, the vending machines only sold one drink—“Oasis”—besides water.  
                My family told me that in the past there were also sports drinks like FIN, but I never knew why they were removed.</p>
                <p>By the time I was in my third year of senior high, a 7-11 vending machine was introduced,  
                which saved us poor students—though I thought it was still quite overpriced.</p>
